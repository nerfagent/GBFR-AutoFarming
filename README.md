# GBFR-AutoFarming
With this program, you can farm any quests that have a difficulty level of "extreme" or lower.
# Guideline
Module versions perhaps don't matter, since they are less related.
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install easyocr
pip install numpy
pip install pyautogui
pip install pynput
```
Accept a quest, then run autoFarming.py
