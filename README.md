# GBFR-AutoFarming
* With this program, you can farm any quests under all difficulties using Lancelot.
* Still, you may fail the quests if your build is too weak.
* My experiment: it can farm Pyet-A, Behemoth, but can't farm Proto Bahamut.
# Guideline
Module versions perhaps don't matter, since they are less related.
```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install easyocr
pip install numpy
pip install pyautogui
pip install pynput
pip install keyboard
```
Set the game language to English, resolution = 1080p (both ingame and windows setting), accept a quest, then run autoFarming.py
